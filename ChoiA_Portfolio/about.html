      <p class="aboutparagraph">Growing up in Seoul, South Korea, I developed a passion for art and design at a young age. As someone who grew up in South Korea, my cultural background has played a significant role in shaping my perspective as a designer. In Korea, there is a strong emphasis on beauty and aesthetics in all aspects of life, from architecture to fashion to food. This appreciation for design and beauty has influenced my approach to design, as I prioritize creating visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing designs. I pursued this passion in high school by majoring in Visual Communication Design (VICM) and later moved to the United States in 2018 to continue my education. Moving to the United States in 2018 was a significant transition for me, both personally and professionally. It allowed me to gain exposure to different design styles, techniques, and approaches that I had not encountered before. Being immersed in a new environment also allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to think differently, be more creative, and push the boundaries of my design abilities.
