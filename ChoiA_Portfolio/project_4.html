      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The purpose and goal of the design is to make a personal logo for me as a designer. I will focus on finding out my identity as a designer and what kind of design I want. Because I will focus on my identity, I will use my name to let people know about me as a designer and sell myself. The client is me. As a college student studying design, my goal is to make my own logo for my portfolio to get a job after graduating from college. The opportunity I want is for the interviewers to recognize my values and identity. I want the audience to understand me as a hardworking, persistent, perfectionist, and creative designer while looking at the design. My target audience is companies that want to hire designers. I would like to appeal to recruiters in graphic design and industrial design. Also, after my career at work, when I work as a freelancer, the clients who want my design can be my audience. Specific limitations or guidelines are for two or three colors of neat design or matching in black, gray, and white.  I want to convey that I am a designer who creates 3D and 2D, balanced, modern, and innovative designs. The personality that my design works will convey should show a mechanical, professional, modern and neat image.</p>
