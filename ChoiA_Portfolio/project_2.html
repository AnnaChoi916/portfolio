      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>a visually striking design that captures the essence of the event. This poster is designed to promote a typeographer's presentation event featuring James Edmondson with Stephen Coles of the Letterform Archive. The poster's title "Obviously influential type!" is prominently displayed at the top of the poster, catching the viewer's attention right away. The subtext "James Edmondson with Stephen Coles of the Letterform Archive" provides important information about the event, while the date, time, and location are clearly stated in the lower section of the poster. The use of a black to purple gradation background creates a sense of depth and intrigue, setting the tone for the event. The letters are designed as white lines with pink and blue out gradation color that look like fluorescence light, which adds an element of excitement and creativity to the poster.  </p>
